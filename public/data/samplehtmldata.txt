    <h1>Matter in our Surroundings</h1>
    <h2>Key Points</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition of Matter:</strong> Everything in the universe is made up of material called matter, including air, food, stones, clouds, stars, plants, animals, water, and sand.</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Properties:</strong> Matter has mass and occupies space, meaning it has both mass and volume.</li>
        <li><strong>Classifications:</strong> Early Indian philosophers classified matter into five basic elements (Panch Tatva) - air, earth, fire, sky, and water. Modern scientists classify matter based on physical properties and chemical nature.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Characteristics of Particles of Matter</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Particle Nature:</strong> Matter is made up of tiny particles.</li>
        <li><strong>Space Between Particles:</strong> There is space between particles, as seen in the diffusion of substances like salt or potassium permanganate in water.</li>
        <li><strong>Particle Motion:</strong> Particles of matter are continuously moving, possessing kinetic energy that increases with temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Particle Attraction:</strong> Particles of matter attract each other, with the strength of this force varying between different types of matter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>States of Matter</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Solid State:</strong> Solids have a definite shape, distinct boundaries, and fixed volumes. They are rigid but can break under force.</li>
        <li><strong>Liquid State:</strong> Liquids have no fixed shape but have a fixed volume. They are not rigid and can flow.</li>
        <li><strong>Gaseous State:</strong> Gases are highly compressible and fill their containers completely. They diffuse very fast due to the high speed and large space between particles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Change of State</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Melting and Boiling Points:</strong> Matter changes state when energy changes, characterized by melting points and boiling points.</li>
        <li><strong>Sublimation and Deposition:</strong> Some substances can change directly from solid to gas (sublimation) or gas to solid (deposition) without passing through the liquid state.</li>
        <li><strong>Effects of Pressure and Temperature:</strong> Pressure and temperature can influence the state of matter, such as liquefying gases or causing sublimation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Evaporation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Evaporation is the process of liquid changing into vapors at any temperature below its boiling point.</li>
        <li><strong>Factors Affecting Evaporation:</strong> Surface area, temperature, humidity, and wind speed can affect the rate of evaporation.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooling Effect:</strong> Evaporation causes cooling as the liquid absorbs energy during the process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The study of matter and its properties is fundamental in understanding the physical world around us. From the smallest particles to the different states matter can exist in, these properties play a crucial role in our daily life and the environment.</p>
