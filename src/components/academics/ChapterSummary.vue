    <p><strong>Chapter Title:</strong> Matter in our Surroundings</p>
    <h4>Key Points</h4>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em">
      <strong>Definition of Matter:</strong> Anything that occupies space and
      has mass, including air, food, stones, clouds, stars, plants, animals, and
      even small particles like water or sand.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em">
      <strong>Early Classifications of Matter:</strong> Ancient Indian and Greek
      philosophers categorized matter into basic elements like air, earth, fire,
      water, and sky.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em">
      <strong>Modern Classifications of Matter:</strong> Based on physical
      properties and chemical nature.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em">
      <strong>Physical Nature of Matter:</strong> Matter is made up of
      particles.
    </p>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 1em">Particle Nature and Behavior</h5>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em">
      <strong>Small Size:</strong> Particles of matter are extremely small.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em">
      <strong>Spaces Between Particles:</strong> There is space between
      particles, allowing for diffusion and movement.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em">
      <strong>Constant Motion:</strong> Particles are always moving, and this
      movement increases with temperature.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em">
      <strong>Forces of Attraction:</strong> Different strengths of attraction
      exist between particles in different states of matter.
    </p>
    <h4>States of Matter</h4>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 1em">Solid</h5>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em">
      <strong>Properties:</strong> Definite shape, distinct boundaries, fixed
      volume, and are not easily compressible.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em">
      <strong>Behavior:</strong> Particles are closely packed with strong forces
      of attraction.
    </p>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 1em">Liquid</h5>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em">
      <strong>Properties:</strong> No fixed shape but fixed volume, takes the
      shape of the container, and is less compressible than gases.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em">
      <strong>Behavior:</strong> Particles are less tightly packed than in
      solids and can move freely.
    </p>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 1em">Gas</h5>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em">
      <strong>Properties:</strong> No fixed shape or volume, highly
      compressible.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em">
      <strong>Behavior:</strong> Particles move randomly at high speeds with
      large spaces and weak attraction between them.
    </p>
    <h4>Changes in State</h4>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em">
      <strong>Melting:</strong> Solid to liquid by increasing temperature.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em">
      <strong>Boiling:</strong> Liquid to gas by increasing temperature.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em">
      <strong>Sublimation:</strong> Direct change from solid to gas.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em">
      <strong>Deposition:</strong> Direct change from gas to solid.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em">
      <strong>Effect of Pressure:</strong> Changing the state of matter by
      applying pressure.
    </p>
    <h4>Evaporation</h4>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em">
      <strong>Definition:</strong> Change of liquid into vapors below its
      boiling point.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em">
      <strong>Factors Affecting:</strong> Surface area, temperature, humidity,
      wind speed.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em">
      <strong>Cause of Cooling:</strong> Energy is absorbed from surroundings
      during evaporation, causing a cooling effect.
    </p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em">
      <strong>Diffusion:</strong> Intermixing of particles of two different
      types of matter due to their kinetic energy.
    </p>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 1em">Latent Heat</h5>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em">
      <strong>Latent Heat of Fusion:</strong> Heat required to change a solid to
      a liquid at its melting point.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em">
      <strong>Latent Heat of Vaporization:</strong> Heat required to change a
      liquid to a gas at its boiling point.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Exercises and Activities:</strong> Various activities and
      questions to reinforce the concepts of the properties and behavior of
      matter in different states.
